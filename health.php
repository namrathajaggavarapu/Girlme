  <h3>PREGNANCY:</h3>  
        <p>Importance of awareness and healthy diet during pregnancy: </p><br>
        <h3>Healthy diet:</h3><t></t> <p>A balanced and healthy diet during pregnancy is crucial for both the mother and the developing foetus. Proper nutrition can help reduce the risk of birth defects, preterm labor, and low birth weight. It is important to consume foods rich in nutrients such as folic acid, iron, calcium, protein, and vitamins.</p><br> 
        <h3> Avoiding harmful substances:</h3><t></t> <p> Expecting mothers should avoid alcohol, tobacco, and drugs as these can cause harm to the developing foetus and increase the risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, and stillbirth. </p><br>
        <h3> Regular prenatal care</h3><t></t> <p>Prenatal care is important for monitoring the health of both the mother and the foetus. Regular check-ups can help identify and manage any health issues that may arise during pregnancy. </p><br>
